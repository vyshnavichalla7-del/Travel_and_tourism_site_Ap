        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Kanaka Durga Temple, located atop Indrakeeladri hill by the Krishna River, is one of the oldest and most revered temples in Andhra Pradesh. Its origins trace back to ancient Hindu mythology, with references found in texts such as Kaalika Purana and Durgaa Sapthashati. It is believed the idol of Goddess Kanaka Durga is Swayambhu (self-manifested). The temple is linked with legends from the Treta Yuga, including Goddess Durga's victory over the demon Mahishasura, as well as the story of Lord Indra performing penance at Indrakeeladri and being blessed by the goddess. The temple was significantly developed during the Vijayanagara Empire period and has been an important spiritual center since ancient times. The idol is known for reportedly changing colors throughout the day, symbolizing different forms of the goddess.
