        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>The Devaragattu Temple is believed to have been established many centuries ago, with its roots tracing back to ancient times. It is said to be located in a spot where the great sage Agastya performed penance and meditated.</li>

<li>The temple is known for its association with Lord Shiva in the form of a Lingam, which is said to have appeared naturally (swayambhu) in the region. According to local legends, Devara Gattu means "the hill of gods," and the place is said to have been named after a divine event that occurred here.</li>

<li>The temple is located in a picturesque gorge, surrounded by hills, and is considered to be a site where the divine energy of Lord Shiva is especially potent. It is believed that anyone who visits and prays at the temple will receive divine blessings and protection from evil forces.</li>

<li>Another story related to the temple's history revolves around a devotee who, after years of penance, was granted a vision of Lord Shiva, which solidified the temple's importance among the local communities.</li>

<li>The temple has undergone several renovations over time, but the core structure has remained faithful to the traditional architectural style of ancient temples in the region.</li>
