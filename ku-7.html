        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Sri Raghavendra Swamy was a renowned Hindu saint, philosopher, and proponent of the Dwaita Vedanta philosophy founded by Madhvacharya. He was born in 1595 in Bhuvanagiri, near Mysore, Karnataka, as Venkatanatha.</li>

<li>After completing his early education, he became a disciple of the great scholar Vyasatirtha and later took sanyasa (renunciation) and was named Raghavendra Tirtha. He dedicated his life to teaching, spiritual practice, and serving society.</li>

<li>Swamy spent many years at the Mantralaya monastery in Andhra Pradesh, where he guided thousands of devotees and scholars through his teachings and miracles. He composed many devotional hymns and commentaries on sacred texts.</li>

<li>Sri Raghavendra Swamy is particularly remembered for his unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu and his compassionate service to his followers. He is believed to have entered samadhi (a state of conscious leaving of the body) in 1671 at Mantralaya, but devotees believe he continues to bless his followers spiritually.</li>

<li>His legacy lives on through the Raghavendra Matha at Mantralaya, which remains a major pilgrimage site attracting devotees from all over India.</li>
