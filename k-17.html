        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Presiding Deity: The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Mukti Rameswara Swamy. The name translates to “Lord Rama’s Shiva who grants Mukti (liberation)”, linking the temple to both Lord Shiva and Lord Rama.</li>

<li>Legendary Connection: As per local belief and oral traditions, Lord Rama is said to have worshipped Lord Shiva here to atone for the sin of killing Ravana (a Brahmin). This parallels the more famous Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, and hence the deity is called Mukti Rameswara — the liberator Lord worshipped by Rama.</li>

<li>Spiritual Significance: The temple is considered one of the most powerful in the Pushpagiri region. Devotees believe that worshipping here helps in attaining moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death). It is especially visited by those seeking relief from ancestral curses or Pitru Dosha.</li>

<li>Architectural Style: The temple features a classic Dravidian architectural style, though smaller in scale compared to major South Indian temples. It includes a Shiva Lingam, a small mandapa, and simple but spiritually charged surroundings.</li>

<li>Historical Period: The temple likely dates back to the 9th–10th century CE, with contributions from Chola and Vijayanagara rulers, who supported temple building and rituals in the Pushpagiri region.</li>
