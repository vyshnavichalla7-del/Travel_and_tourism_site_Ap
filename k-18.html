        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Founding and Patronage: The temple's origins trace back to the 11th century CE, attributed to Kulottunga Chola I, who ruled from 1069 to 1122 CE. Subsequent contributions were made by the Kakatiya dynasty, notably Prataparudra I, who constructed the gopuram and donated land for temple upkeep. Further enhancements occurred under the Vijayanagara Empire, with Saluva Narasimha Raya reportedly worshipping here before his reign.</li> 


<li>Architectural Features: The temple complex spans 14 acres and is constructed primarily of red sandstone. It features 108 intricately carved pillars, a Deepastambham (lamp pillar) adorned with lion-head motifs, and four Raja Gopurams (grand entrance towers) positioned at each cardinal direction. The sanctum houses a 7-foot-tall idol of Lord Soumyanatha Swamy, depicted with an Abhaya Hastham (gesture of protection), distinguishing it from the Kati Hastham (gesture of holding a club) seen in other Vishnu idols.</li> 


<li>Cultural Significance: The temple has attracted numerous historical figures, including poets and saints. Notably, Annamacharya, the renowned Telugu saint-composer, is believed to have composed several keertanas in praise of Lord Soumyanatha Swamy during his visits.</li>
