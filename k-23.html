        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>The name Gandikota comes from two Telugu words: “Gandi”, meaning gorge, and “Kota”, meaning fort. The site is famous for the deep gorge of the Penna (Pennar) River cutting through the Erramala hills.</li> 


<li>The fort dates back to around 1123 A.D., when a chieftain named Kapa Raja (or Kakaraja), a subordinate of the Western Chalukya king (Ahavamalla Someswara I) of Kalyani, founded a small sand‑fort at this location. Over time, the fortifications were expanded.</li>

<li>Under the rule of the Kakatiya dynasty, Gandikota grew in importance. Later, during the period of the Vijayanagara Empire, its fortifications were significantly enhanced and many structures (temples etc.) inside the fort were built or renovated. </li>


<li>After Vijayanagara came the era of Muslim rule: Gandikota fell under the control of the Qutb Shahis, and later the Mughal empire. During these periods, some Islamic architecture was added, including a mosque inside the fort.</li>

<li>The fort also came under the influence of local rulers known as the Pemmasani Nayakas, a powerful lineage of commanders under Vijayanagara. They controlled the fort for several centuries, contributing to its fortifications and structural development.</li>

<li>French traveler Jean‑Baptiste Tavernier visited Gandikota in the 17th century and was struck by its grandeur. He compared it to Hampi, particularly in terms of its monumental structures and fortifications.</li> 


<li>Within the fort, there are multiple important structures: Hindu temples (like the Madhavaraya / Madhava Temple and Ranganatha Temple), a large granary, a palace, a pigeon tower, and also the Jama Masjid (mosque). These reflect the mixed heritage: Hindu, Vijayanagara, and Islamic influences.</li>

<li>The geography contributes immensely to the fort’s defensive strength — the gorge and steep cliffs along with the river provide natural defence on multiple sides. </li>
