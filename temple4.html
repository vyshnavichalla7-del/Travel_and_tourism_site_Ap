        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The ISKCON Temple in Rishikonda, Visakhapatnam, was started in May 1999 by an ISKCON devotee couple, Sri Samba Das and his wife Nitaisevini Dasi, following the directive of their guru. Initially, they began with minimal resources, spreading the message of Krishna consciousness across Andhra Pradesh. In 2005, they acquired land in Sagar Nagar, Visakhapatnam, where the temple complex was planned and constructed. The temple, a large spiritual and cultural center, houses deities such as Radha Damodar, Hanuman, Lakshman, and others, and offers facilities like a multimedia theatre, naturopathy center, seminar hall, and guest house. Despite setbacks like Cyclone Hudhud in 2014 damaging the earlier structure, the temple was rebuilt and continues to serve as a prominent place for devotion, meditation, and community activities.
