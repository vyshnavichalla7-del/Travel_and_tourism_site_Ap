        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Ashta Lakshmi Temple in Visakhapatnam (located in Kommadi area) is a relatively modern temple dedicated to the eight forms of Goddess Lakshmi, representing different aspects of wealth, prosperity, and well-being. The foundation of the temple was laid in 1991, and the consecration took place in 1996. The temple features beautiful white marble architecture and houses the main goddess Ashtalakshmi along with Sri Lakshmi Narayana. It also includes additional shrines such as a Sivalayam with a shining Spatika Lingam and a statue of Sri Adi Shankara. The temple is a spiritual hub, attracting many devotees, especially women, and has regular rituals that celebrate the divine blessings of Lakshmi's eight forms.
