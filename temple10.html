        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Brahmalingeshwara Temple, located in Balikatam (also known as Balighattam or Balighat) near Narsipatnam in Visakhapatnam district, is a historic temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Brahmalingeshwara. According to legend, the temple was established by Lord Brahma himself to honor Shiva after the penance of King Bali Chakravarthi. The river beside the temple, called Varahanadi, is said to have been created by Lord Vishnu in his Varaha (boar) incarnation, and white clay found along the riverbank is believed to be the ashes of a sacrificial fire performed by Bali.

The temple is considered highly sacred due to the unique orientation of the Shiva lingam facing west and the river flowing north for a distance, symbols associated with spiritual significance equated to Kashi (Varanasi). The temple hosts major festivals such as Maha Shivaratri and Karthika Masam, attracting many devotees. Nearby, there is an ashram of the saint Sri Chidagadandula Swamy and a temple dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi developed by Sri Padmavathi Ammavari. The site is revered for its peaceful atmosphere and deep spiritual vibrations.
