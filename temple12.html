        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Sri Dakshina Kashi Vishwanath Swami Temple in Mallavaram, Visakhapatnam, is often referred to as the "Dakshina Kashi" (Southern Kashi) due to its spiritual significance similar to the famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva in his form as Vishwanath, the ruler of the universe. It holds great importance for devotees seeking spiritual liberation (moksha).

The temple is a prominent pilgrimage site in Andhra Pradesh and features traditional Hindu temple architecture. Many devotees visit this temple to perform rituals and seek blessings similar to those offered at Kashi in the north. It is believed to have been constructed to give devotees in the south an accessible place to experience the spiritual essence of Kashi. The temple also serves as a center for various religious festivities, especially Maha Shivaratri.

The historical and spiritual significance aligns with the broader tradition of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, where Vishwanath in Kashi is one of the most revered among them.
