        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Constructed during the 15th century by the Vijayanagara kings Harihara and Bukka Raya, the temple follows Vaishnavite traditions. According to local legends, the sage Agastya intended to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara at this site. However, due to a flaw in the idol, he redirected his penance towards Lord Shiva. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva manifested as Uma Maheswara—a combined form of Shiva and Parvati—carved from a single stone, fulfilling Agastya's request.</li>

<li>Another legend speaks of a devotee named Chitteppa, who, upon witnessing Lord Shiva in the form of a tiger, joyously exclaimed, "Neganti Shivanu ne kanti" (meaning: "I saw Shiva, I saw"). This exclamation led to the naming of the place as Yaganti.</li>

<li>The temple is also associated with Sri Potuluri Veera Brahmendra Swamy, a renowned saint who is believed to have spent time here and composed the Kalagnanam, a prophetic text.</li>
