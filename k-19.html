        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Following his untimely death, the Andhra Pradesh government established YSR Ghat at his native village, Idupulapaya, to honor his legacy and contributions to the state's development. The memorial serves as a place for public homage and reflection, attracting thousands of visitors annually, especially on the anniversary of his death.</li>

<li>In 2012, the YSR Memorial Park was inaugurated at YSR Ghat. The park was developed by the State Tourism Development Corporation at a cost of â‚¹26 crore. The foundation stone for the park was laid by Union Minister A. Sai Pratap, along with other dignitaries, in May 2012. The park features landscaped gardens, pathways, and a serene environment, providing visitors with a space to pay their respects and reflect on the late leader's contributions</li>
