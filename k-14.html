        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Deity: The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Sangameswara, which means “Lord of the Confluence.” The name refers to the confluence (sangam) of two rivers near the temple: the Pinakini (Penna) and a smaller stream, believed to be sacred.</li>

<li>Historical Period: The temple dates back to the early medieval period, roughly between the 7th and 10th centuries CE. Like other temples in Pushpagiri, it received patronage from various South Indian dynasties including the Cholas, Pallavas, and later the Vijayanagara Empire.</li>

<li>Architectural Style: The temple architecture is in Dravidian style, with a modest but spiritually powerful sanctum (garbha griha), a small mandapa (pillared hall), and carvings depicting Shaivite themes.</li>

<li>Spiritual Significance: According to local belief, this temple was built at the site where many sages performed penance and rituals. The confluence nearby is considered highly sacred, and taking a dip here is thought to cleanse sins. The temple is particularly significant during Shivaratri and other Shiva-related festivals.</li>

<li>Cultural Note: Pushpagiri was once known as "Dakshina Kasi" (Kasi of the South), and Sangameswara Temple played an important role in this reputation, due to its riverside location and sanctity.</li>
