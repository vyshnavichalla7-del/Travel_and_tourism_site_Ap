        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>üïâÔ∏è History
<li>The Sri Rama Temple in Kurnool has a long and rich history that dates back to ancient times. While the exact date of its establishment is unclear, it is believed to have been constructed many centuries ago during the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire or earlier.</li>

<li>According to local legends, the temple is linked to the story of Lord Rama's exile. The town of Kurnool, known for its proximity to sacred sites like the Srisailam Temple, is thought to be a place that Lord Rama passed through during his exile. In the temple's mythology, it is believed that Lord Rama, along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, visited the region during their journey and offered prayers to Lord Shiva at nearby sacred locations, including Srisailam.</li>

<li>The temple itself enshrines an idol of Lord Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, which is believed to have been consecrated by the local rulers during the temple's early history. This idol is of great significance and is a focal point for prayer and worship.</li>

<li>The architecture of the temple reflects the traditional Vijayanagara style, with beautiful carvings and sculptures depicting scenes from the Ramayana. The temple complex is adorned with intricate stonework, including depictions of Lord Rama's life, his vanquishing of demons, and his journey back to Ayodhya.</li>

<li>Over time, the temple has been renovated and expanded, especially during the 19th and 20th centuries. Many local kings and prominent patrons have contributed to the temple's development, ensuring that it continues to be an important place of worship and pilgrimage.</li>

<li>The temple is also closely associated with the Ram Navami festival, which marks the birth of Lord Rama. The temple attracts large crowds during this festival, where devotees gather to celebrate with special rituals, poojas, and cultural events.</li>
