        <h2>History</h2>
        <p><li>The name “Siddavatam” is believed to come from “Siddhas” (yogis or seekers) and “vata” (banyan tree), because many Siddhas lived in this area under banyan trees.</li> 

<li>Under the rule of King Varadha Raju (who was son‑in‑law of the famous king Krishna Deva Raya), the fort was further developed — major fortification work, stone ramparts, bastions etc.</li> 

<li>In 1605, the fort was given as a gift by Vijayanagara ruler to Yellama Raju and his son Anantha Raju, in reward for their support in war. Anantha Raju is said to have remodeled or strengthened the fort, turning parts of it from a mud fort into a rock/stone fort.</li> 


Over time, the fort came under different rulers:

<li>In the 17th century, it passed into control of Nawabs (Muslim rulers) of the Kadapa region. </li>

<li>Hyder Ali (of Mysore) attacked it around 1779‑80, capturing the fort.</li> 


<li>Later it came under the Nizam of Hyderabad (around 1792). </li>


<li>By 1800, the British East India Company took over the fort. From around 1807 to 1812, the fort served as the administrative headquarters of Kadapa district under British administration. Eventually, due to seasonal flooding from the Pennar River isolating the fort, administrative center was moved.</li> 


<li>After Indian independence, the fort became protected under the Archaeological (or State / Central heritage) authorities (from about 1956).</li>
